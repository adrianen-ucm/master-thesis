\section{Goals}

\textcolor{red}{TODO}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Use the Elixir macro system to implement a verification system 
    for Elixir itself.
  \item To integrate \acrshort{smt} solvers in Elixir and offer a \gls{dsl} 
    to specify restriction problems.
  \item Develop a verification \gls{ir} to express Erlang terms and its 
    dynamically typed nature.
  \item Translate the developed \gls{ir} into the previous \gls{dsl}.
  \item Design a mechanism to translate a subset of the Elixir 
    programming language into the verification \gls{ir}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Non-goals}

\textcolor{red}{TODO}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Concurrency.
  \item Termination (i.e. only partial verification for the moment).
\end{itemize}

\section{Work plan}

\textcolor{red}{TODO}

Describe the work plan to achieve the proposed goals.
