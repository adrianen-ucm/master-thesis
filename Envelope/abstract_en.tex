\section*{\tituloPortadaEngVal}

This project addresses the formalization and implementation of a code
verification system for Elixir, a dynamically typed programming language with
functional programming principles. Our system is inspired by projects like Dafny
and will likewise rely on a verification intermediate representation, which will
be the translation target of a supported Elixir subset plus ghost verification
annotations, and the use of SMT solvers for its verification. The
metaprogramming capabilities of Elixir through macro expressions make this
language suitable for developing domain-specific languages, and may allow us to
provide our implementation in Elixir itself without requiring us to modify its
compiler or to implement a parser. Due to the broad scope of the project, we
have restricted us to deal only with sequential code and partial verification.
