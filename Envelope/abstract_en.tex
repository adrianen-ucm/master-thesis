\section*{\tituloPortadaEngVal}

This project addresses the formalization and implementation of a verification
system for Elixir, a dynamically typed programming language with functional
programming principles. Our system is inspired by projects like Dafny and will
likewise rely on a verification intermediate representation, which will be the
translation target of a supported Elixir subset plus ghost verification
annotations, and uses SMT solvers for its verification. The metaprogramming
capabilities of Elixir through macro expressions make this language suitable for
developing domain-specific languages, and allows us to provide our
implementation in Elixir itself without requiring us to modify its compiler or
to implement a parser. Due to the breadth of the project, we have restricted the
scope to sequential code and partial correctness verification.
