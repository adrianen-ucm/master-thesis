\chapter{DSL example: Hamiltonian path problem}
\label{Appendix:hamiltonian}

This appendix shows a longer usage example of our developed \gls{dsl} to 
communicate with an \acrshort{smt} solver from Elixir. It corresponds to the
\gls{csp} of checking whether a given graph has a Hamiltonian path or not.

A Hamiltonian path is a path that visits each node exactly once, and it can be 
expressed as a \gls{sat} problem by specifying it as a \gls{csp} and encoding 
its constraints as propositional formulas.

We are going to write it as an Elixir script (i.e. code that is not provided 
under a \verb|module| and can be directly evaluated by \verb|iex|). It will
involve some Elixir usage that has not been presented in this document (e.g. 
the \verb|pin| operator, the \verb|pipe| operator, comprehensions, etc.), but we
hope that the comments will clarify the idea:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=elixir,numbers=none,frame=none]
import SmtLib

# The problem input: a graph
nodes = 0..3
edges = MapSet.new([{0, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}])

# A variable identifier for every node and path position
# to denote propositional variables meaning that node 
# n is in position i
node_in_position =
  for n <- nodes, {_, i} <- Enum.with_index(nodes) do
    {{n, i}, String.to_atom("p_#{n}_#{i}")}
  end
  |> Map.new()

# We use a default and self-managed solver connection
with_local_conn do

  # Declare all the variables with sort Bool
  for {_, v} <- node_in_position do
    declare_const [{v, Bool}]
  end

  
  # This comprehension stands for pairs of 
  # variables corresponding to different nodes 
  # at the same position
  for {{m, i}, v1} <- node_in_position, 
      {{n, ^i}, v2} <- node_in_position, 
      n !== m do
      # Nodes do not collide in their positions
    assert !(v1 && v2)
  end

  # This comprehension stands for pairs of variables 
  # corresponding to different nodes in adjacent path 
  # positions that are not adjacent in the graph
  for {{m, i}, v1} <- node_in_position,
      j <- [i + 1],
      {{n, ^j}, v2} <- node_in_position,
      n !== m,
      {m, n} not in edges do
    # Non adjacent nodes cannot be in adjacent positions 
    assert v1 ~> !v2
  end

  # Every node is at least in some position
  for n <- nodes do
    # This reduce generates a disjunction with 
    # all the positions of the node
    assert Enum.reduce(
             Enum.with_index(nodes),
             quote(do: false),
             fn {_, i}, acc ->
               quote do
                 unquote(acc) 
                  || unquote(node_in_position[{n, i}])
               end
             end
           )
  end

  check_sat
end

# Print the result of the block, that is,
# the result of check_sat
|> IO.inspect()
\end{lstlisting}

And, for the given problem input, its evaluation prints 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=elixir,numbers=none,frame=none]
{:ok, :sat}
\end{lstlisting}

meaning that there exists an assignment for the defined variables that satisfies
the specified formulas, thus the graph has a Hamiltonian path.
